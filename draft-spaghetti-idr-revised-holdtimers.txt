1.  Introduction

   The introduction goes here

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Updates to RFC 4271

   Few words need to be changed in [RFC4271].

   OLD: 6.5.  Hold Timer Expired Error Handling

   If a system does not receive successive KEEPALIVE, UPDATE, and/or
   NOTIFICATION messages within the period specified in the Hold Time
   field of the OPEN message, then the NOTIFICATION message with the
   Hold Timer Expired Error Code is sent and the BGP connection is
   closed.

   NEW: 6.5.  Hold Timer Expired Error Handling

   If a system does not send and receive successive KEEPALIVE, UPDATE,
   and/or NOTIFICATION messages within the period specified in the Hold
   Time field of the open message, then the BGP connection is closed and
   a log message is emitted.

3.  Security Considerations

   Withdraws stuck Routing loops TCP receive window 0
