  <section title="Introduction" anchor="sect-1">

    <t>
	Since the BGP Protocol <xref target="RFC4271" /> runs over TCP <xref target="RFC793" /> it is
  possible for hosts in ESTABLISHED state to encounter a peer that is advertising
  a zero windows size and preventing KEEPALIVE, CEASE, WITHDRAW, UPDATE and other
  critical messages from being sent.

  Since implementaions themselvs do not have a way to handle this, this often results
  in a soft Denial Of Service either to handling messages or delivering reachablity
  information to other peers.
    </t>

    <section title="Requirements Language">

      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
        "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in BCP 14 <xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC2119"/> <xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all
        capitals, as shown here.

    <t>
	OLD: 6.5.  Hold Timer Expired Error Handling
    </t>
    <t>
	If a system does not receive successive KEEPALIVE, UPDATE, and/or
	NOTIFICATION messages within the period specified in the Hold Time
	field of the OPEN message, then the NOTIFICATION message with the
	Hold Timer Expired Error Code is sent and the BGP connection is
	closed.
    </t>

    <t>
	NEW:
	6.5.  Hold Timer Expired Error Handling
    </t>
    <t>
	If a system does not send and receive successive KEEPALIVE, UPDATE,
	and/or NOTIFICATION messages within the period specified in the Hold
	Time field of the open message, then the BGP connection is closed and
	a log message is emitted.
