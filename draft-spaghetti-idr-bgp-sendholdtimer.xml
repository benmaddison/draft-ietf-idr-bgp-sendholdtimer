  <abstract>

    <t>
      This document defines the SendHoldTimer session attribute for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Finite State Machine (FSM).
      A session should be terminated if the TCP receive window is zero for the duration of the Hold Timer, in this situation the peer is expected to terminate the connection.
      For robustness, this document specifies that the local system should also close the connection.

      This document updates RFC4271.

    <t>
      This document defines the SendHoldTimer session attribute for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) <xref target="RFC4271" /> Finite State Machine (FSM) defined in section 8.
      A session should be terminated if the TCP <xref target="RFC0793" /> receive window is zero for the duration of the Hold Timer, in this situation the peer is expected to terminate the connection.
      For robustness, this document specifies that the local system should also close the connection.
    </t>

    <t>
      The BGP runs over TCP it is possible for hosts in ESTABLISHED state to encounter a peer that is advertising a zero windows size and preventing KEEPALIVE, CEASE, WITHDRAW, UPDATE and other critical messages from being sent.
    </t>

    <t>
      Since implementations themselves do not have a way to handle this, this often results in a Denial Of Service either to handling messages or delivering reachablity information to other peers.

      This phenomena is theorised to have contributed to IP traffic backholing events in global Internet routing system.

  <section title="Changes to RFC 4271" anchor="sect-2">

    <t>
        In section 8 BGP Finite State Machine (FSM) <xref target="RFC4271"/>. The following mandatory session attributes are added
    </t>

    <t>
      <list style="empty">
          <t> 
              9) SendHoldTimer
          </t>

              10) SendHoldTime
          </t>
      </list>
    </t>

    <t>
	OLD: 6.5.  Hold Timer Expired Error Handling
    </t>
    <t>
	If a system does not receive successive KEEPALIVE, UPDATE, and/or
	NOTIFICATION messages within the period specified in the Hold Time
	field of the OPEN message, then the NOTIFICATION message with the
	Hold Timer Expired Error Code is sent and the BGP connection is
	closed.
    </t>

    <t>
	NEW:
	6.5.  Hold Timer Expired Error Handling
    </t>
    <t>
	If a system does not send and receive successive KEEPALIVE, UPDATE,
	and/or NOTIFICATION messages within the period specified in the Hold
	Time field of the open message, then the BGP connection is closed and
	a log message is emitted.
